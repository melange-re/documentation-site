# Melange Playground

[Melange Playground](https://melange.re/v2.0.0/playground/) is an interactive
environment for running OCaml code and seeing its output. It will also show the
JavaScript generated by the Melange compiler. It's also a great way to share
code snippets---the URL can be copied and pasted into another tab, recreating
the exact source code inside the code editor.

In the next section, we'll use the Melange Playground to explore OCaml's numeric
types.

## OCaml numeric types

Unlike JavaScript, OCaml makes a clear and hard distinction between integer and
float types. Try running the following program in the playground:

```reasonml
let foo = 42;   // int
let bar = 42.1; // float
Js.log(foo);
Js.log(bar);
```

Note that you didn't have to write the types yourself, OCaml is able to infer
the types from the literals, e.g. `42.1` could only be assigned to a variable of
type float. For example, this wouldn't work:

```reasonml
let bar: int = 42.1;
```

The error you get would look something like this:

```
Line 1, 15:
  Error This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type int
```

Now change the program to this:

```reasonml
let foo = 42;   // int
let bar = 42.0; // float
Js.log(foo == bar);
```

You'll get a compiler error for the last line that says

```
This expression has type float but an expression was expected of type int
```

Unlike JavaScript, there are no implicit conversions in OCaml. Therefore you
cannot expect to compare an integer and a float together, unless you convert one
of the values so that both values have the same type. To make the last line
compile, you can change it to

<!--#prelude#
let foo = 42;
let bar = 42.0;
-->
```reasonml
Js.log(foo == Int.of_float(bar));
```

Another way to fix the last line is to convert `foo` from an int to a float:

<!--#prelude#
let foo = 42;
let bar = 42.0;
-->
```reasonml
Js.log(Float.of_int(foo) == bar);
```

What about addition? From what you've already seen, you can probably guess that
`Js.log(42 + 16.0)` won't compile. However, you may be surprised to discover
that `Js.log(42.0 + 16.0)` also won't compile! That's because OCaml uses
separate arithmetic operators for floats. What will compile is this:

```reasonml
Js.log(42.0 +. 16.0); // prints 58
```

Underneath the covers, `foo` and `bar` are both instances of JavaScript's
`Number` type:

```reasonml
let foo = 42;   // int
let bar = 42.0; // float
Js.log(Js.typeof(foo)); // prints "number"
Js.log(Js.typeof(bar)); // prints "number"
```

Refer to the [Melange docs](../communicate-with-javascript.md#data-types-and-runtime-representation)
for a complete rundown of how OCaml types get translated to JavaScript types.

## Exercises

<b>1.</b> Convert the Counter component we created in the previous chapter to
use float instead of integer. Make the `-` button decrement by `0.5` and the `+`
button increment by `1.5`.

<b>2.</b> Add an int64 value to your program in Melange Playground:

```reasonml
let baz = 42_000_000_000L; // int64
Js.log(baz);
```

Note the use of underscores to make the large number more readable. What is the
JavaScript representation of int64?

<b>3.</b> How do you add two int64 values? Hint: Take a look at the standard
library's
[Int64 module](https://melange.re/v2.0.0/api/re/melange/Stdlib/Int64/index.html).

## Overview

- Melange Playground is a great way to play around with short OCaml programs
- Integer and float are separate types in OCaml, but both translate to
  JavaScript's `Number` type once your program is compiled
- Float arithmetic operators are not the same as integer arithmetic operators

## Solutions

<b>1.</b> A Counter component that uses float instead of integer would look
something like this:

```reasonml
[@react.component]
let make = () => {
  let (counter, setCounter) = React.useState(() => 0.0);

  <div
    style={ReactDOMStyle.make(
      ~padding="1em",
      ~display="flex",
      ~gridGap="1em",
      (),
    )}>
    <button onClick={_evt => setCounter(v => v -. 0.5)}>
      {React.string("-")}
    </button>
    <span> {counter |> Float.to_string |> React.string} </span>
    <button onClick={_evt => setCounter(v => v +. 1.5)}>
      {React.string("+")}
    </button>
  </div>;
};
```

<b>2.</b> JavaScript's `Number` type doesn't have enough precision to represent
in64 values. They're instead represented by an array of two numbers `[high,
low]`, where `high` is signed, `low` is unsigned.

<b>3.</b> You can add two int64 values using `Int64.add`, e.g. `Int64.add(42L, 16L)`.
