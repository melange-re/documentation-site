# Melange Book

## Introduction

This is a project-based, guided introduction to Melange and its ecosystem. Because Melange integrates both OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, there are a lot of tools and topics to learn, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. Therefore we try to make each chapter small and digestible, not introducing too many things at once.

## Audience

You should already know how to make frontend applications in JavaScript, and familiarity with React will be very helpful. It would help to know the basics of Reason (OCaml), but we'll mostly stick to fairly basic Reason in this tutorial, and anything that isn't basic will be explained.
