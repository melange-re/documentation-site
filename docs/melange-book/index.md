# Melange Book

## Motivation

This is a project-based, guided introduction to Melange and its ecosystem.
Because Melange uses both OCaml and JavaScript ecosystems, there are a lot of
tools and concepts to learn, which can be overwhelming for newcomers. Therefore
we try to make each chapter small and digestible, not introducing too many
things at once.

## Audience

You should already know how to make frontend applications in JavaScript, and
familiarity with [React](https://react.dev/) will be very helpful. You do not need to know
OCaml--we'll slowly introduce the basics of the language throughout the
tutorial.
