# Installation

## Prerequisites

- You are running a Unix system
  - Windows users are encouraged to install [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)
- You have a recent version of, and know how to use:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  - [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Opam

We need opam, the OCaml Package Manager. There are many ways to install it
depending on your platform, but let's go with the simplest method:

    bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh)"
    opam init
    eval $(opam env)

While `opam init` is running, it will prompt you with something like "Do you
want opam to modify ~/.profile?". Type `y` to agree.

## Melange opam template

Let's make sure that everything works by downloading and running
[melange-opam-template](https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template).

    git clone https://github.com/melange-re/melange-opam-template
    cd melange-opam-template
    make init
    make build
    make serve

While `make init` you can consider grabbing some coffee or other beverage, as it
might take a while the first time. The last command, `make serve`, should open a
tab in your default browser which points to http://localhost:8081/ and shows
you a typical "Hello World" page.

## OCaml Platform Visual Studio Code Extension

Open the Extensions tab in Visual Studio Code and search for "ocaml". Install
the [OCaml
Platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform)
extension from OCaml Labs. To verify that the extension worked, open the
melange-opam-template we downloaded in the last step in Visual Code. Code should
be syntax highlighted, and you should see type annotations when you hover over
variables.
