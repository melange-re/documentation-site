## Working locally

After cloning the repository, install the necessary Python packages:

```
python3 -m pip install -r ./pip-requirements.txt
```

Then run `mkdocs serve .` from the folder where the repository lives.

### (Optional) Tooling for docs generation

Optionally, to run some of the tools to auto-generate parts of the
documentation, you will need an opam switch with the required dependencies. To
set it up, run:

```
make init
```

## Writing code snippets

All code snippets should be written in OCaml syntax. A development-time script
is available to automatically generate Reason syntax snippets from the OCaml
ones. Before running this script, you will need to set up an opam switch.
Instructions can be found in the ["Tooling for docs
generation"](#optional-tooling-for-docs-generation) section.

To run the script:

```
dune build @re
```

To promote any changes to the original `md` file, one can run:

```
dune build @re --auto-promote
```

## Publishing

Publishing is done automatically from GitHub actions:
- Every commit to `master` will publish in the `unstable` folder
- Every tag pushed with the `v*` format will publish on its correponding folder,
  and set it as default
